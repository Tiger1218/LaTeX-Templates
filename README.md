# Tiger1218's (self-use) LaTeX templates

There's nothing worth watching.

## Install

! The Install Script is Only for Linux Users

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

The default installation path is the **System LaTeX PATH** !

That's just my preference. For installing in the user LaTeX Path, just change the `INSTALL_HOME` variable.

## TO-DO

- [ ] rewrite the package with multi-argument
- [ ] .sty -> .cls
- [ ] add more meta macro (After finishing the `The TeXBook`)
- [ ] add more comments
- [ ] merge with SCUCCS Report Templates
